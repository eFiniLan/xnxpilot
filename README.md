What is xnxpilot?
------
xnxpilot (Xavier NX Pilot) is an open source driver assistance system based on [dragonpilot](http://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot) and [openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot), running on a NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform instead of a qualcomm 821 mobile phone.



If you would like to run it with minimal changes to openpilot, please see the example in "doc" branch, based on openpilot 0.8.4 
-YJ- base on dragon pilot 0.8.9

Software Requirement
------
- [NVIDIA JetPack 4.6](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetpack-sdk-46)

---

Hardware assembly
------
It is important to know that your camera needs **firmly attached** onto your windshield, any small movement to the camera while driving may result dangerous steering/acceleration.

I highly recommended to 3D print those commaai windshield mount (use with gopro mount) and use it to mount your camera, 24 degree one will do the job.

---

Installation
------
1) [Install ubuntu 18.04 / Jetpack 4.6 on to sdcard](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-xavier-nx-devkit)
2) Insert your sd card to your jetson, have camera connect to CAM0, boot up, use the following configuration (installer will use those values to set up the device):
  - username: **comma**
  - password: **comma**
  - hostname: **tici**
  - mode: **20W 6 cores**

3) Once installation finished, **SSH into the device** and continue the rest of the processes.
4) run:
  - `sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/jetson-io.py`
  - select `Configure Jetson Nano CSI Connector` > `Configure for compatible hardware` > `Camera IMX477 Dual` > `Save pin changes` > `Save and exit without rebooting`.

5) clone this repo to your home directory (e.g. `cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/efinilan/xnxpilot.git openpilot -b 0.8.9 --single-branch`)
6) run `cd ~/openpilot/jetson/ && sudo bash env_installer.py`
7) Take a rest, this will take around **1.5 hrs** to config your system and another **10 mins** to compile dragonpilot, depends on your internet connection.
8) Congradulations, you have dragonpilot running on your jetson.

Notes
------
#### set_core_affinity ####
Jetson Xavier NX has 6 cores running at 1.9 GHz, here is what I've defined:

0 = camerad

1 = modeld

2 = boardd

3 = controlsd

4 = plannerd / radard

This will spread processes other CPU cores.
